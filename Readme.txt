This software allows the user to interactively select two patches to compare.

In this program, we use the SwitchBetweenStyle class to use the InteractorStyleTrackballActor for the left mouse button and the InteractorStyleImage for the other buttons.
This switching, along with setting the image and mask Pickable=off allows us to drag around the small image patches, while still controlling the camera (to pan and zoom) with the other mouse buttons.
